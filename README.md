<h1 style="font-size: 36px;">Photos Clone with Spring Boot</h1>

This is a tiny Google Photos-like clone built with Spring Boot. In this project, I learn how to use Spring's Dependency Injection and MVC frameworks, Validation and File Handling, Spring Data and Databases, and deploy your application at the end.

The application allows users to:

Upload photos with a name and content type.
View all uploaded photos.
Delete photos.
<h3 style="font-size: 36px;">Prerequisites</h3>
Java 11 or later
Maven 3.6 or later
H2 Database 2.1.210 or later

The application is ready for deployment to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS. You'll need to set up a database and configure the database connection string in the application.properties file.
