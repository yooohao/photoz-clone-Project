#Google Photos Clone with Spring Boot
This is a tiny Google Photos-like clone built with Spring Boot. In this project, I learn how to use Spring's Dependency Injection and MVC frameworks, Validation and File Handling, Spring Data and Databases, and deploy your application at the end.

Features
The application allows users to:

Upload photos with a name and content type.
View all uploaded photos.
Delete photos.
Prerequisites
Java 11 or later
Maven 3.6 or later
H2 Database 2.1.210 or later
Usage
Clone this repository
Navigate to the project root directory
Run the following command: mvn spring-boot:run
Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8080/photoz
Deployment
The application is ready for deployment to a cloud platform like Heroku or AWS. You'll need to set up a database and configure the database connection string in the application.properties file.
